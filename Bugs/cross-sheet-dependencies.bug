Summary::md .summary
  Tracking at the cellular level is an optimization, but we need to be able to
  output what other sheets depend on so we can accurately refresh.

Updated Jan 16, 2023, 12:13AM::md .update
  Cellular stuff can just aggressively refresh, but sheets need a notification
  unless we want to recall literally every sheet.
